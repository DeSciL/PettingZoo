# PettingZoo
Code and Circuit Diagrams for giving Roomba's personality

# About
The [robotic petting zoo](https://www.roboticpettingzoo.com/) project was produced at the [SoBA Lab](http://www.soba-lab.com/), within the Psychology Department, at Bangor University. The technical requirement for the project was to control a robotic vacuum cleaner to display a certain personality and play a characteristics sound when it bumped into any objects as it went about doing the cleaning task. This document details how to go about doing this for anyone who wants to try to give their Roombas a personality.
